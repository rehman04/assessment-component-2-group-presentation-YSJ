#Predicting Medical Costs Using Machine Learning
Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting medical charges for individuals based on their personal attributes such as age, BMI, smoking status, and other factors. The analysis aims to support healthcare providers and insurance companies in budgeting, resource allocation, and setting fair premiums.

We explore data exploration, preprocessing, model development, evaluation, and ethical implications in this end-to-end machine learning pipeline.
